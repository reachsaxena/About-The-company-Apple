                    <p class="info-p">Apple Computers, Inc. was founded on April 1, 1976, by college dropouts<br>
                         Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, who brought to the new company a vision of<br> changing the way people viewed computers.
                         One more thing that changed<br> over time
                          is their logo. The first logo looked like a Apple fall on newton's head.<br>
                          And the most
                          recent one looks like a gray Apple.
